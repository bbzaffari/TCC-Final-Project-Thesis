# Overview


Maintaining optimal humidity and temperature levels in cold storage rooms is essential for preserving the shelf life and quality of perishable goods. However, in countries like Brazilâ€”where fruit warehouses often operate dynamically with frequent door openings and high ambient moistureâ€”conventional monitoring solutions fall short. These environments demand robust, cost-effective, and modular systems that adapt to real-world usage patterns without compromising reliability.

This work presents the development of a scalable monitoring system called Cooling Link, designed to address this issue through a practical and cost-effective approach.
